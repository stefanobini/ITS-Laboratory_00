# GDPR Notes (minimal)

## Personal Data in Scope
- Partner contact data (name, email, phone, address) â€” **personal data**.
- No special categories (health, religion, etc.) are processed.

## Minimization
- Keep only what is necessary for warehouse operations.
- Use **synthetic data** (Faker) for seeds; no real personal data in the repo.

## Consent
- Provide the **Google Form link** in the shared Drive. Include a reference/link in the delivery ZIP.

## Security (basic)
- Local development only; no public exposure.
- Do not commit secrets; `.env` is not tracked.
